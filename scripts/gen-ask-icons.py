"""Generate the three awaiting-input expressions for the ESP32-S3 8x8 matrix:
ask-question / ask-confirm / ask-attention. Fired by the Claude Code hooks when
Claude is waiting for the user (see the awaiting-input spec).

Design notes (emoting-on-8x8 + docs/LED_BRIGHTNESS.md):
- These play at the board's CURRENT brightness, which is often the bri-5 ambient
  floor — where FastLED's (channel x (bri+1))>>8 kills any channel below ~43. So:
  - the confirm BOX uses a bright gray #b8b8b8 (184 -> survives) not a dim gray that
    would vanish at bri 5;
  - the question mark uses cyan #44eeff (red 0x44=68, survives) like the wait-logo set;
  - the attention BELL is amber #ffb000 — note its green channel (176) lands near the
    floor at bri 5, so amber reads more orange/red there; the bell SHAPE carries the
    meaning. Flagged for live tuning with the user's eyes.
- loop:0 so each HOLDS until a later display command replaces it (Claude waiting).
Output is the saved-expression format; re-run to overwrite the JSON in place.
