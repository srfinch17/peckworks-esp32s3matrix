"""Generate the four animated-logo wait expressions for the ESP32-S3 8x8 matrix:
wait-logo-breathe / chase / boot / ripple.

All four animate the board's quincunx LOGO — five 2x2 blocks:
  TL green, TR amber, center cyan, BL amber, BR green
(the same motif as the favicon / header.js logo).

Design notes (see emoting-on-8x8 skill + docs/LED_BRIGHTNESS.md):
- At low global brightness FastLED's (channel x (bri+1))>>8 kills weak channels, so
  full-sat colors shift hue (amber->red, green loses blue, cyan loses red). To keep
  the center reading as CYAN we bump it to #44eeff (red 0x44=68, above the bri-5
  floor of ~43). For the same reason the dimmest in-frame level used here is ~0.45,
  never near-zero, so a "dim" block stays a recognizable color instead of vanishing.
- Output is the saved-expression format (Expression interface): text-art rows using
  per-(color,level) chars + a colors map. Frames stay <= 24 (firmware MAX) and the
  logo is sparse (<= 20 lit px/frame), so the payload is featherweight. Re-run after
  tuning; it overwrites the JSON in place.
