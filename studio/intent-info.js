// studio/intent-info.js — curated, human-readable "fires when" descriptions for each
// manifest intent, derived from the Claude Code harness moment map
// (manifest.harnesses["claude-code"].moments: hook:* -> intent) and the hook semantics.
// The editor shows INTENT_FIRES[intent], falling back to the manifest's terse `doc`.
// Hook-fired intents name their trigger; discretionary and fallback-only intents say so.
